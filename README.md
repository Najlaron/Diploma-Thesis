# Diploma-Thesis
Code, graphs, tables, etc. used in my diploma thesis.

## Why?
Multiple Pre-trained word embeddings models were used in combination with Machine learning models to evaluate their performance on the task of identifiyng parts of affiliations.
Chosen (best performing) combination of models (PWE+ML) will be used in pipeline to geolocalize affiliations.
