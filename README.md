# This repository was created as a part of my diploma thesis.
For transparency all codes, and additionally graphs, tables, etc. used in my diploma thesis are shared via this repo.

### What and why?
Multiple Pre-trained word embeddings (PWE) models were used in combination with Machine learning (ML) models to evaluate their performance on the task of identifiyng parts of affiliations.
Chosen (best performing) combination of models (PWE+ML) will be used in pipeline to geolocalize affiliations.

## Name:
Performance evaluation of Machine Learning approaches for identifying parts of scientific affiliations.
## Abstract:
This diploma thesis investigates the suitability of multiple freely available pre-trained word embeddings (PWE) models for the task of geo-localizing parts of affiliations. The analysis employs statistical methods, such as PCA and ANOVA, to identify the most suitable PWE model. PWE models are used in combination with ML classifiers such as Neural Networks, Random Forests, Support Vector Classifier, and K-Nearest Neighbors. The Neural Networks together with uncsd-BERT embeddings model emerges as the best performing combination. Its classification performance and learning process are further evaluated. The thesis serves as a case study illustrating the selection of the best model for a specific classification task, and it provides insights into the state of the art performance of selected embeddings models on this task. The primary goal is to develop a ML model for geo-localizing affiliations without commercial tools.
